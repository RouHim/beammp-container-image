This project provides a small, alpine based, docker container for the [beammp](https://beammp.com) game server and shows
its usage in a docker-compose environment.

## Motivation

Because there were no well-documented, alpine based BeamMP docker images out there, I did one by myself. Building the
BeamMP server is needed, because the prebuilt linux binary uses glibc as C standard library implementation (instead of
musl).

## Usage

The sections below provides use cases for docker and docker-compose.

### docker

Quick start:

```bash
docker run --name beammp-server \
           -p 30814:30814/tcp -p 30814:30814/udp \
           -e NAME='My first awesome Server' \
           -e AUTH_KEY='<insert auth-key>' \
           rouhim/beammp-server
```

### docker-compose

Check `docker-compose.yml` if interested. The configuration should be done within the `.env` file.

To get started copy `.env.example` to `.env`.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Adjust the values in the `.env` to your needs and run:

```bash
docker-compose pull && docker-compose up -d
```

NAME            | What your server is called. This shows up in the Server Browser                                               | BeamMP New Server
DESC            | What shows under the name when you click on the server                                                        | BeamMP Default Description

A new AUTH_KEY can be claimed on [this site](https://beammp.com/k/dashboard), you will need
a [Discord](https://discord.com) account for this. Note that the IP entered there does *not* matter, despite what the
site claims. For more information refer
to [this wiki page](https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/server-installation#h-2-obtaining-an-authentication-key).

## Client mods

In the first place you should consider
reading [the official mods guide](https://wiki.beammp.com/en/home/server-installation#how-to-add-mods-to-your-server).

> The folder `client-mods` is created automatically during the first startup with docker compose,
> but can also be created manually beforehand.

Mods can be downloaded from the [official BeamNG resources website](https://www.beamng.com/resources/). Just copy the
downloaded zip file into the `client-mods` folder.

### Custom maps:

Copy the downloaded zip file into the `client-mods` folder.

Now we have to find out the custom map path name (e.g.: `/levels/car_jump_arena/info.json`), to set it later as the map
to load.

To do so:

1. Execute the shell command below, or open the zip file manually.
2. Copy the absolute path to the `info.json` location (`/levels/{map-name}/info.json`).
3. Set in .env file: `MAP=/levels/{map-name}/info.json`. Example: `MAP=/levels/car_jump_arena/info.json`

A simple way to print the full map path including info.json (_unzip_, _grep_ and _awk_ is required):

```shell
unzip -l PATH/TO/MAP.zip \
  | grep 'levels/.*/info.json' \
  | awk '{split($0,a," "); print "/"a[4]}'
```
